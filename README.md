voting-ponies.user.js
=====================

Watch Karma and Descentia vote for you as you click on the up and downvote button on [r/mylittlepony][1]. Karma and Descentia sprites modified from http://evilhom3r.deviantart.com/art/Desktop-Ponies-Karma-and-Dis-264326413 and http://browse.deviantart.com/art/Pinkie-teleporting-273635955 and are licensed under Creative Commons 3.0 BY-SA-NC. 

### TODO

 - Reduce fragility of script by not having the script parse and call `$.fn.vote` on its own 
 - Find a way to **simulate** delayed voting action instead of actually delaying voting
